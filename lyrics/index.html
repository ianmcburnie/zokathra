            <pre>
Baby come cry, baby come cry
Oh baby come cry, baby come cry
You can cry, you can cry
 
Let the tears run dry, let the tears run dry
Oh let the tears run dry, let the tears run dry
When the tears are dry, when the tears are dry

I'll kiss those eyes, I'll kiss those eyes
I'll kiss those eyes, I'll kiss those eyes
And you can fly, you can fly

Then we can try, then we can try
We can try, we can try

            <pre>
Wake up, baby wake up, baby wake up
Before tomorrow's gone

Before it's gone, before it's gone, before it's gone
And I'll still dream of you

I'll dream of you, I'll dream of you, I'll dream of you
Before tomorrow's gone

            <h2 id="blood">Blood</h2>
            <pre>
We pay the price of love
We pay the price of love
We pay the price in blood
Blood, blood, blood

Do we close our hearts for good
Do we close our hearts for good
Or pay the price of love
Love, love, love

To live and die it hurts
To live and die well it hurts
So we pay the price of love
Love, love, blood

            <h2 id="breathe">Breathe</h2>
            <pre>
Sometimes we know are good, so good
And times we know, we should, we should

Breathe, breathe

Those times we know, we could, we could
Those times we know, we should, we should

Breathe, breathe

Breathe, breathe
Breathe, breathe

            <h2 id="pain">Chronic Pain</h2>
            <pre>
I'm choking on her latest mail
I'm sure she's gone insane
But I won't play her little games
Gotta fix my chronic pain

The lawyer's on a big retainer
And it's me that's gotta pay her
But I won't pay for little games
Gotta fix my broken heart and take it

Her momma thinks I'm out to lunch
Not sure but that's my hunch
I won't play their little games
Being the big man can save us

I gotta learn to decompose it
Well that's the way that I suppose it
I won't play their little games
I gotta fix my chronic pain
            </pre>

            <h2 id="crazy">Crazy</h2>
            <pre>
Goodbye baby, I remember when
You held me and told me not to run
Well I didn't run, though I should've done
I stayed with you, I stayed and I was true

That was my first mistake
The tears were rolling down your face
I didn't know how crazy
Crazy, crazy

Goodbye baby, I remember when
You held me and told me not to run

Well I didn't run, though I should've done
I stayed with you, I stayed and I was true

That was my first mistake
The tears were rolling down your face
I didn't know how crazy
Crazy, crazy

Goodbye baby, I remember when
You held me and told me not to run
Goodbye baby, I remember when
You held me and told me not to run
Goodbye baby, I remember when
You held me and told me not to run

            <pre>
I spoke to the sun, sun today
She said boy, you know she's not the only, only way
There's a star she fills my sky today
With her light, her light hey hey

And I spoke to the moon, moon today
He said boy, you know she's not the only, only way
I put a star in your sky please pray
For her light, her light, hey hey

Sun, moon, dance me to her soon (repeat)

            <pre>
I like her cherry lips
The taste of sweetness

She does backflips
And they always hit
I know, I know, about this

Dirty secrets, dirty secrets

            <pre>
If I say to you
love fades away
What do you do?
What do you do? What do you do?
What do you do? What do you do?

Everybody breaks up
Oh it's true, oh it's true
Oh it's true, oh it's true

If I say to you
love finds a way
What do you do?
What do you do? What do you do?
What do you do? What do you do?

Everybody breaks up
Love needs a little shake up
Everybody has to break up 
Oh it's true, oh it's true
Oh it's true, oh it's true

Everybody breaks up
Oh it's true

Everybody breaks up
Love needs a little shake up
Everybody has to break up 
Oh it's true, oh it's true
Oh it's true, oh it's true
Oh it's true, oh it's true
Oh it's true, oh it's true

Everybody breaks up
Oh it's true

I once had a love, true love

            <h2 id="bed">Make My Bed (Don't Make Me Well)</h2>
            <pre>
Emily has begun
Pressing flowers in the sun
Crimson red, black and gold
Take us to a troubled world

Emily, I've drank my fill
And I can't love you when I'm this way
Come make my bed but don't make me well
I'll sleep through morning and I'll start again

Alison has begun
Putting words to a song
Minor key minor eight
Take us to a sad, sad place

Alison I've drank my fill
And I can't love you when I'm this way
Make my bed but don't make me well
I'll sleep through morning and I'll start again

Emily has begun
Pressing flowers in the sun
Crimson red, black and gold
Take us to a troubled world
            </pre>

            <h2 id="mystery">Mr. Mystery</h2>
            <pre>
Face to face with the past
Two black spiders spinning traps
Oh Mr Mystery
Oh Mr Mystery
Why can't you see?

Memories and photographs
Eyes are burdened in every laugh
Oh Mr Mystery
Oh Mr Mystery
Oh Mr Mystery
Why can't you see?

Mr Mystery don't waste the energy on attack
Nobody's time is free all the things we feel will elapse
So Mr Mystery won't you smile for me and don't turn back
Mr Mystery don't waste the energy on attack

Kiss me slow kiss me fast
Nothing matters when nothing lasts
Oh Mr Mystery
Oh Mr Mystery
Oh Mr Mystery
Why can't you see?

Mr Mystery don't waste the energy on attack
Nobody's time is free all the things we feel will elapse
So Mr Mystery won't you smile for me and don't turn back
Mr Mystery don't waste the energy on attack
Nobody's time is free all the things we feel will elapse
So Mr Mystery won't you smile for me and don't turn back
Mr Mystery don't waste the energy on attack

            <h2 id="sunbeam">No Time or Place / Every Little Sunbeam</h2>
            <pre>
I was breaking it down, breaking things down
Breaking down, breaking it down
And I said, I said, I said
I said it would come to this
To this, to this, to this

The clock on the wall, the keys by the door
The telephone's place, it's never been missed
Like my kiss, like my kiss, like my kiss
There's no time or place for this
For this, for this, for this

I was breaking it down, breaking things down
Breaking down, breaking it down
In my head, in my head, in my head
I never though it would come to this
To this, to this, to this

Three years at war, keeping the score
I've forgotten your face, and sometimes it's missed
Like your kiss, like your kiss, like your kiss
There's no time or place for this
For this, for this, for this

Every little sunbeam creeps into my dream
Every little sunbeam creeps into my dream
Every little sunbeam creeps into my dream
Every little sunbeam creeps into my dream

            <h2 id="spell">Only You Can Break The Spell</h2>
            <pre>
I, I was doing well
Yeah I, I was doing well
As far, as far as I could tell
Things, things were going swell

Then things all went to hell

And I want my honey back
Yeah I want my honey back
Yeah I want my honey back

But you, you weren't doing well
No you, you weren't doing well
As far, as far as you could tell
Things, things weren't going swell

Only you can break the spell

Do you want your honey back
Do you want your honey back
Do you want your honey back
Do you want the good times back
Do you want the good times back
Do you want the good times back
Do you want the good times back
Do you want the good times back

            <h2 id="wild">She's Wild, She's Free</h2>
            <pre>
Crystal slides away, she had nothing to say
Angel takes her place, an angel with a face

And she's wild and free, and she talks to me
Yeah she's wild and free, yeah she talks to me

In the deepest sea, blue turns to green
Aquamarine haze, aquamarine days

And she's wild and free, and she talks to me
Yeah she's wild and free, yeah she talks to me

Summer devasates, winter takes its place
I have a cold blue heart, come back and make it start

And she's wild and free, and she talks to me
Yeah she's wild and free, yeah she talks to me
And she's wild and free, and she talks to me
Yeah she's wild and free, yeah she talks to me
            </pre>

            <h2 id="dark">The Dark of Light</h2>
            <pre>
When we were young we had the sun in our hair
When you were mine I took your light everywhere

Those reckless days reckless nights should we care
Our mindless words our mindless thoughts if we dare

And now the night it takes us home takes us there
Come kiss my eyes and feel my breath in the air
            </pre>
            <hr />
            <h2 id="trees">The Falling Trees of Youth</h2>
            <pre>
Maybe I was scared
Maybe there's truth
That baby it had me
I couldn't cut loose

I was snared by the falling trees of youth

Troubled intentions
Don't bring no sense of peace
Troubled intentions
Don't bring a storm to cease

I was snared by the falling trees of youth

With limbs stripped bare
And the sky on its back
Our dark temptations
Lie dangerously stacked

I was snared by the falling trees of youth
            </pre>
            <hr />
            <h2 id="river">The River</h2>
            <pre>
I pushed our boat on the water
It felt like the river wasn't there
I pushed out boat on the water
It felt like the river didn't care

All of the time we were talking
All of the time we were there
It felt like the river wasn't moving
It felt like the river didn't dare

These dreams I have, I'm lucky to have
These dreams I have, I'm lucky to have
Every single night you look so fine
Every single night you could be mine

I pushed our boat on the water
It felt like the river wasn't there
            </pre>

            <h2 id="christmas">This Christmas</h2>
            <pre>
This Christmas, Santa told me
This Christmas, would be the best of all
This Christmas, I'll hear the sleigh bells ringing
This Christmas, I'll taste the snow as it falls

Well I don't intend to end the year so lonely
Well I don't intend to end the year so cold

This Christmas, I'll say my graces
This Christmas, for my girl

I don't pretend those winter nights weren't lonely
I don't pretend those winter nights weren't cold 
Well I don't intend to end the year so lonely
And I don't intend to end the year so cold

Well I don't intend to end the year so lonely
And I don't intend to end the year so cold
But I wont pretend those winter nights weren't lonely
Well I won't pretend those winter nights weren't cold

This Christmas, I'll say my graces
This Christmas
